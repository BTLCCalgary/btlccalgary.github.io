    <p class="testimonial">“After my son was diagnosed with autism, I was desperate to find a school where his teachers would understand his disability and work to reduce it, not just work around it.  I appreciate the team approach to treatment and always feel like an important member of that team.  Sometimes it takes a long time to meet goals and I feel frustrated.  Then I talk to his teachers and am comforted that they are not giving up, and that they care about his success almost as much as I do.  In my opinion BTLC is the best I can do for my son.  I don’t think there is anything out there that can compare to the dedication, expertise, and personalized treatment plans that I have seen at BTLC”</p>
     
    <p class="testimonial">“Our family moved to a new city so that our son could attend BTLC.  As soon as I heard about the program I knew it was the right early intervention program for him.  We had to wait almost a year to get started and it has definitely been worth the wait to see him making such great progress.  It seems that every week the teachers at BTLC are telling me about a new goal that has been mastered and they are sometimes even more excited than I am.  I feel lucky to have found such a caring and knowledgeable team to help my son to recover from autism”</p>
