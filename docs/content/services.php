<p>Programs and services are provided to children between the ages of 2 ½ to 6, living in Calgary and surrounding communities (e.g. Airdrie).  BTLC’s comprehensive and specialized onsite preschool program has a low staff-to-child ratio to ensure the children receive the intensity and support that they require to learn while maintaining the structure and expectations of a typical classroom. In addition to the programming provided by the Certified Teacher and Educational Assistants, the onsite classroom benefits from the recommendations and support of a Special Education Consultant and a Behaviour Consultant.</p>

<p>Our program also offers opportunities for children to be integrated, when appropriate, within regular community preschool or Kindergarten classrooms.  Children registered in our integrated program are typically supported by one of our trained educational assistants, with program development and consultation provided by our Special Education and/or Behaviour Consultants.</p> 

<p>BTLC's comprehensive and dynamic Individualized Program Plans (IPPs) are tailored to meet the needs of each individual child that attends our program. In addition to language, social and academic skills, we emphasize teaching functional behavioural skills such as: self-control, resistance to distraction, frustration tolerance, anxiety management, etc.  The development of behavioural skills is significant in terms of allowing a child to learn and participate in the community without restriction, requiring less support and without being vulnerable or susceptible to bullying.</p>
 
<p>Frequent family oriented programming sessions (home visits with parents) assist in generalizing the skills learned with the classroom setting to the child's home and allow the benefits of learning to continue beyond the classroom hours.</p>

<p>Many PUF-eligible children also qualify for specialized services funding through <a href="http://www.child.alberta.ca/home/591.cfm" target="_blank">Family Support for Children with Disabilities (FSCD)</a>.</p>

<p>Although it is a separate organization, BTLC was actually created by Autism Partnership to promote efforts in providing an integrated, coordinated, and effective program for preschool children with ASD or developmental disabilities. For a consistent approach to teaching, we highly recommend that children involved in a BTLC program also access home services through Autism Partnership if they are eligible for FSCD funding.
