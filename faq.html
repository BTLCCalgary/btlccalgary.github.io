                    <div class="question">1. What are the hours of the school day?</div>
<div class="answer">BTLC currently offers an onsite morning preschool program Monday to Friday from 9:00am-12:00pm. If it is determined that a child may benefit from full or partial integration, hours of school will vary depending on the placement chosen by the family.</div>

<div class="question">2. What is your ratio of staff to students?</div>
<div class="answer">For our onsite program, one staff member generally assists one or two students. For children involved in offsite programs, one aide will accompany one child to his/her offsite school placement.</div>

<div id="picFaq"><img src="images/pic/watercolor_rainbow.jpg" alt="Picture of boy holding painting of a rainbow"/></div>

<div class="question">3. How does the onsite classroom operate?</div>
<div class="answer">Our classroom models the structure of a typical classroom. Students will experience circle time, centers, snack time, music, etc; the difference is that these activities will be modified to work on each child’s individual goals. We also operate more hours (3 hours per day, 5 days per week) than most typical preschool classrooms. This allows us to provide higher intensity in our program, as research has shown that intensity will produce greater learning outcomes for children with developmental delays.</div>

<div class="question">4. Besides classroom instruction and/or assistance, will my child receive any other services?</div>
<div class="answer">All children, regardless of whether they are in onsite or offsite classrooms, will have an Individualized Program Plan (IPP) created for them. They will also receive consultation from a combination of the following: 
    <ul>
        <li>Behaviour Consultant</li>
        <li>Family-Oriented Programming Consultant</li>
        <li>Special Education Consultant</li>
        <li>Speech Language Pathologist</li>
        <li>Occupational Therapist</li>
        <li>Physical Therapist</li>
    </ul>

<div class="question">5. How is this program funded? Is there a tuition fee?</div>
<div class="answer">The program is largely funded through Alberta Education by PUF (Program Unit Funding). Program Unit Funding is available for children with severe disabilities/delays who are at least 2 years, 6 months of age and less than 6 years of age. If a child is eligible for PUF, the BTLC administrator will submit an application for funding. While PUF funding does cover the majority of BTLC’s costs, there is an additional tuition fee to help offset the costs associated with providing this specialized program. Please contact us for more information about tuition fees.
<br/>
<br/>

<div class="question">5. Do you provide transportation?</div> 
<div class="answer">No, we do not have transportation options at this time; it is the parent’s responsibility to provide transportation to and from school. BTLC staff meet the children at the door each morning and bring them back to their parents at the end of the school day.</div>


<div class="question">6. My child doesn’t have autism, but does have a developmental delay. Can we access your services?</div>
<div class="answer">While the majority of the children in our program have a diagnosis of autism, we do have the ability to tailor individual program goals to meet the needs of children with other developmental delays as well. Contact our administrator if you would like to discuss your child’s particular needs.</div>

<div class="question">7. How long do students usually stay at BTLC?</div>
<div class="answer">That really depends on the child’s needs and how many years of PUF funding he or she has when starting with us. Some children stay with us for the full three years that they are eligible for PUF, and during that time they may progress from being fully onsite to integrating into placements at other schools. We will continue to work with children in our program until they reach school age; at that point, we will assist the family in transitioning to another program or school.</div>

<div class="question">8. Is there a Specialized Services Program that you would recommend to complement BTLC's preschool program?</div>
<div class="answer">Many of the children in our program also qualify for funding for specialized services through <a href="http://www.child.alberta.ca/home/591.cfm" target="_blank">Family Support for Children with Disabilities (FSCD)</a>. BTLC is affiliated with an organization called Autism Partnership (AP), which designs and supervises FSCD-funded home programs for children with autism. We highly recommend contacting Autism Partnership for specialized services if your child attends BTLC.
