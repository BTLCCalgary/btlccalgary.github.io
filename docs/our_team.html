              BTLC consists of a dedicated group of professionals committed to
              providing exceptional educational programming to our students. Our
              team includes the Executive Director, Behaviour Consultant,
              Special Education Consultant, Teacher, Educational Assistants, and
              Administrators.

            <div class="heading">Executive Director</div>
            <p>
              The Executive Director has a very key role at BTLC. The person in
              this role oversees planning, implementation, and evaluation of the
              school programs and services (both onsite and offsite). This
              includes leading the development and review of IPPs for the
              students, coordinating with and supervising the Teacher and other
              professionals involved in the program, acting as transition
              facilitator for children leaving the program, managing PUF
              applications, and much more. The Executive Director also works
              closely with the Administration team to keep everything running
              smoothly behind the scenes.
            </p>

            <div class="heading">Behavioural Consultant</div>
            <div id="picRight">
              <img
                src="images/pic/kids_at_table_2.jpg"
                alt="Picture of kids at a table"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              The Behavioural Consultant develops behaviour intervention plans
              for the children in our program and provides assistance to the
              Teacher and Educational Assistants in implementing those plans and
              strategies. He or she also summarizes and interprets behaviour
              data that has been collected and participates in the IPP process.
            </p>

            <div class="heading">Special Education Consultant</div>
            <p>
              The Special Education Consultant must be a Certificated Teacher
              with appropriate training and experience. He or she provides
              support to the classroom teacher and recommends materials and
              resources for programming, providing demonstration of activities
              as needed to address IPP goals. The Special Education Consultant
              will also assist the Teacher in identifying training goals and
              providing support for Educational Assistants to enhance the
              education of the children in the classroom. In addition to the
              above, the person in this role is involved with the development,
              assessment, and review of the IPPs.
            </p>

            <div class="heading">Teacher</div>
            <p>
              The BTLC Teacher is responsible for developing a classroom
              environment with activities that are age-appropriate yet adaptable
              to the varied target objectives of each student. Every month the
              Teacher plans activities around a specific theme and addresses
              each child’s IPP goals through circle time, songs, stories, group
              activity centers, outings, and much more. The Teacher also
              provides leadership for the Educational Assistants, coordinates
              consultations with all other members of the learning team, and is
              responsible for the development, review, and assessment of each
              child’s IPP.
            </p>

            <div class="heading">Educational Assistants</div>
            <p>
              Working closely with the Teacher, the educational assistants help
              to plan and implement learning activities for the children in the
              classroom and keep the students as engaged as possible. They run
              activity centers in class, adapt activities based on
              recommendations from other team members and keep the classroom
              running smoothly.
            </p>

            <div class="heading">Ancillary Support Services</div>
            <p>
              Additional support may be contracted by a registered Speech
              Pathologist (SLP), Occupational Therapist (OT), and/or Physical
              Therapist (PT)
            </p>

            <div class="heading">Administrators</div>
            <p>
              Agency policies, accounting, staffing, marketing, scheduling,
              coordination with the learning team and families: these are just a
              few of the many tasks that the Executive Director and
              Administrators are responsible for on a daily basis. These
              professionals work hard to keep the program running behind the
              scenes.
