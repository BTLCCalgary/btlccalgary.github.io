              Choosing an effective treatment for your child requires careful
              judgment. There are a lot of therapy options out there, and the
              choices can be overwhelming. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) has
              been shown to be the most researched and scientifically proven
              treatment to-date. BTLC uses an ABA approach to teaching in our
              preschool program.
            </div>

            <p>
              ABA is a field of psychology that focuses on applying learning
              theories to improve socially significant behavior and bring about
              positive change. One specific application of these techniques is
              intensive behavioural intervention for children with autism.
              Teaching techniques based on ABA have been shown to significantly
              improve the abilities of children with autism and other
              developmental delays to learn and develop.
            </p>

            <p>
              The techniques of ABA are grounded in science. Some of the
              hallmarks of ABA include:

            <p class="heading">Effectiveness of ABA</p>

            <p>
              Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) is based upon more than 50 years
              of scientific investigation with individuals affected by a wide
              range of behavioural and developmental disorders. Research has
              shown ABA to be effective in reducing disruptive behaviours such
              as self-injury, tantrums, non-compliance, and self-stimulation.
              ABA has also been shown to be effective in teaching commonly
              deficient skills such as complex communication, social, play and
              self-help skills. Two seminal studies by Lovaas (1987), and
              McEachin, Smith and Lovaas (1993), have proven the efficacy of
              ABA. Many studies have also been undertaken since this time which
              replicate these findings and provide additional support for the
              techniques.

            <p class="heading">ABA & Contemporary Behaviour Therapy</p>

            <p>
              BTLC’s approach to ABA treatment of autism differs in many
              fundamental ways from the more rigid application of ABA.
              Therefore, to distinguish our approach we identify it as
              Contemporary Behavior Therapy (CBT).

            <p class="heading">What is Discrete Trial Teaching (DTT)?</p>

            <p>
              DTT is a teaching process used to develop most skills, including
              behavioural, cognitive, communication, play, social, motor
              development, self-help, and adaptive skills. It is strategy that
              can be used for all ages and populations and not just for teaching
              children with autism. Good DTT does not require that a child be
              sitting at a table or using flashcards and does not involve
              aversive procedures of any kind. The process takes into account
              the child’s developmental level and can be very natural and child
              and family friendly.

              A teaching session involves numerous trials, with each trial
              having a distinct beginning and end, hence the name "discrete".
              Each part of the skill is mastered before more information is
              presented. In DTT, a very small unit of information is presented
              and the child's response is immediately sought. This contrasts
              with continuous trial or more traditional teaching methods, which
              present large amounts of information with no clearly defined
              target response on the child's part.

              Other techniques used in treatment may include behaviour
              management, crisis intervention, structured teaching interactions
              and more traditional counseling.
