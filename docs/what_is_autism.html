              According to Autism Canada there is 1 child in every 165 who is
              diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Autism is a severe
              disruption of the normal development process and is often
              diagnosed within the first few years of life. Autism is viewed as
              a spectrum or a continuum of disorders, with varying degrees of
              severity and levels of functioning. The term Autism Spectrum
              Disorders (ASD) is frequently used interchangeably with autism.
              Diagnoses such as Aspergerâ€™s Syndrome, Childhood Disintegrative
              Disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Autistic Disorder and
              Pervasive Developmental Disorders (Not Otherwise Specified) are
              all included within the umbrella of ASD.

            <p class="heading">Symptoms</p>

            <p>
              While the symptoms of autism vary from child to child, the core
              areas affected include:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Deficits in language and communication</li>
              <li>Impairments in socialization and social interactions</li>
              <li>Undeveloped cognitive and adaptive functioning</li>
              <li>
                Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior and
                interests
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              These essential skill deficits cause children to fall
              progressively further behind their typical peers as they grow
              older. The cause is unknown, but evidence points to physiological
              and neurological abnormalities. Children with autism generally do
              not learn in the same way that children normally learn, because,
              in part, they lack the fundamental skills which enable them to
              acquire and process basic information. These difficulties result
              in significant delays in their development of language, play and
              social skills, including their failure to notice and learn through
              imitation of their peers.
