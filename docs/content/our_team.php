<div>BTLC consists of a dedicated group of professionals committed to providing exceptional educational programming to our students. Our team includes the Executive Director, Behaviour Consultant, Family-Oriented Programming Consultant, Special Education Consultant, Teacher, Educational Assistants, Speech Pathologist, Occupational Therapist, Physical Therapist, and Administrators.</div>

<div class="heading">Executive Director</div>
<p>The Executive Director has a very key role at BTLC. The person in this role oversees planning, implementation, and evaluation of the school programs and services (both onsite and offsite). This includes leading the development and review of IPPs for the students, coordinating with and supervising the Teacher and other professionals involved in the program, acting as transition facilitator for children leaving the program, managing PUF applications, and much more. The Executive Director also works closely with the Administration team to keep everything running smoothly behind the scenes.</p>


<div class="heading">Behavioural Consultant</div>
<div id="picRight"><img src="images/pic/kids_at_table_2.jpg" alt="Picture of kids at a table"/></div>
<p>The Behavioural Consultant develops behaviour intervention plans for the children in our program and provides assistance to the Teacher and Educational Assistants in implementing those plans and strategies. He or she also summarizes and interprets behaviour data that has been collected and participates in the IPP process.</p> 


<div class="heading">Family-Oriented Programming Consultant (FOP)</div>
<p>Through regular programming meetings, the FOP Consultant engages parent(s) in activities that will assist them in implementing their child’s IPP goals and objectives at home and in the community. Plans for these meetings are developed with input from the Teacher, Special Education Consultant, and Behavioural Consultant. While these FOP sessions may be conducted by a dedicated FOP Consultant, they can also be facilitated by a different professional from the learning team who operates under the direction of a Certificated Teacher.</p>


<div class="heading">Special Education Consultant</div>
<p>The Special Education Consultant must be a Certificated Teacher with appropriate training and experience. He or she provides support to the classroom teacher and recommends materials and resources for programming, providing demonstration of activities as needed to address IPP goals. The Special Education Consultant will also assist the Teacher in identifying training goals and providing support for Educational Assistants to enhance the education of the children in the classroom. In addition to the above, the person in this role is involved with the development, assessment, and review of the IPPs.</p>


<div class="heading">Teacher</div>
<p>The BTLC Teacher is responsible for developing a classroom environment with activities that are age-appropriate yet adaptable to the varied target objectives of each student. Every month the Teacher plans activities around a specific theme and addresses each child’s IPP goals through circle time, songs, stories, group activity centers, outings, and much more. The Teacher also provides leadership for the Educational Assistants, coordinates consultations with all other members of the learning team, and is responsible for the development, review, and assessment of each child’s IPP.</p>


<div class="heading">Educational Assistants</div>
<p>Working closely with the Teacher, the educational assistants help to plan and implement learning activities for the children in the classroom and keep the students as engaged as possible. They run activity centers in class, adapt activities based on recommendations from other team members and keep the classroom running smoothly.</p>


<div class="heading">Speech Pathologist (SLP), Occupational Therapist (OT), and Physical Therapist (PT)</div>
<p>Within their disciplines, the SLP, OT, and PT engage in structured and unstructured observation of the children within the setting where their centre-based programming hours are provided. They contribute to the IPP process, consult to and train the classroom staff, and provide hands-on assistance in the implementation of appropriate strategies and recommendations.</p>


<div class="heading">Administrators</div>
<p>Agency policies, accounting, staffing, marketing, scheduling, coordination with the learning team and families: these are just a few of the many tasks that the Executive Director and Administrators are responsible for on a daily basis. These professionals work hard to keep the program running behind the scenes.</p>
