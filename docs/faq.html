            <div class="question">1. What are the hours of the school day?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              BTLC currently offers two specialized preschool classes Monday to
              Friday from 9:00am-12:00pm, and from 1:15pm-4:15pm. If it is
              determined that a child may benefit from full or partial
              integration, hours of school will vary depending on the community
              school placement chosen by the family.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
              2. What is your ratio of staff to students?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              In our specialized classroom, one staff member generally assists
              one or two students. For children involved in community school
              (integrated) programs, one aide will accompany one child to
              his/her community school placement.

            <div class="question">
              3. How does the specialized classroom operate?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              Our classroom models the structure of a typical classroom.
              Students will experience circle time, centers, snack time, music,
              etc; the difference is that these activities will be modified to
              work on each child’s individual goals. We also operate more hours
              (3 hours per day, 5 days per week) than many typical preschool
              classrooms. This allows us to provide higher intensity in our
              program, as research has shown that intensity will produce greater
              learning outcomes for children with developmental delays.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
              4. Besides classroom instruction and/or assistance, will my child
              receive any other services?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              All children, regardless of whether they are in onsite or offsite
              classrooms, will have an Individualized Program Plan (IPP) created
              for them. They will also receive professional consultation based
              on the needs outlined in their IPP. To learn more about the
              professionals involved in our program,

            <!--
<div class="question">5. How is this program funded? Is there a tuition fee?</div>
<div class="answer">The program is largely funded through Alberta Education by PUF (Program Unit Funding). Program Unit Funding is available for children with severe disabilities/delays who are at least 2 years, 6 months of age and less than 6 years of age. If a child is eligible for PUF, the BTLC administrator will submit an application for funding. While PUF funding does cover the majority of BTLC’s costs, there is an additional tuition fee to help offset the costs associated with providing this specialized program. Please contact us for more information about tuition fees.

            <div class="question">5. Do you provide transportation?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              No, we do not have transportation options at this time; it is the
              parent’s responsibility to provide transportation to and from
              school. BTLC staff meet the children at the door before class and
              bring them back to their parents at the end of the school day.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
              6. My child doesn’t have autism, but does have a developmental
              delay. Can we access your services?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              While the majority of the children in our program have a diagnosis
              of autism, we do have the ability to tailor individual program
              goals to meet the needs of children with other developmental
              delays as well. Contact our administrator if you would like to
              discuss your child’s particular needs.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
              7. How long do students usually stay at BTLC?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              That really depends on the child’s needs and how many years of PUF
              funding he or she has when starting with us. Some children stay
              with us for the full three years that they are eligible for PUF,
              and during that time they may progress from being fully onsite to
              integrating into placements at other schools. We will continue to
              work with children in our program until they reach school age; at
              that point, we will assist the family in transitioning to another
              program or school.
            </div>

            <div class="question">
              8. Is there a Specialized Services Program that you would
              recommend to complement BTLC's preschool program?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              Many of the children in our program also qualify for funding for
              specialized services through
              <a href="http://www.child.alberta.ca/home/591.cfm" target="_blank"
                >Family Support for Children with Disabilities (FSCD)</a
              >. We recommend contacting Autism Partnership for specialized
              services if your child attends BTLC. For more information about
              Autism Partnership, visit
